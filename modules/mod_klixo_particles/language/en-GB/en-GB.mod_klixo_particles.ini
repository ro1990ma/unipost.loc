PARTICLES_QTY_LABEL="Particles amount"
PARTICLES_QTY_DESC="Amount of particles to create on the screen. Please note that ridiculously large amount of particles will slowdown or even crash the browser. You should stay within reasonable limits (10 to 30 particles)"
V_SPEED_LABEL="Vertical speed"
V_SPEED_DESC="The vertical speed of the particles. Higher values will cause the particles to move faster in the vertical direction."
V_DIR_LABEL ="Vertical Direction"

LEFT_TO_RIGHT="Left to Right"
RIGHT_TO_LEFT ="Right to Left"
OSCIL_LABEL ="Oscillation"

(You must enter values for width and height in the fields below for this option to function correctly).<br/><strong>Position:</strong> the particles will appear on the template position the particles module is attached to. This option relies on the template css to work. That means the selected position div  MUST HAVE defined height and width values for the particles to display properly."
